# BPM

**BPM** is an iOS application made to help DJs practice mixing vinyl records by ear. It features “tap tempo” with the smart averaging algorithm to help identify song tempo and prompts the user on how to adjust the pitch fader on the turntable to put two records in sync for smooth transition.
